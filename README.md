# Miyoo Mini Plus Data Extraction, Transformation and Integration.
## Introduction
The [Miyoo Mini Plus](https://www.keepretro.com/products/miyoo-mini-plus) (MMP) is a handheld retro gaming console that offers a collection of 6000+ games (For the 64GB model) from various retro consoles, compatible with the [RetroArch](https://www.retroarch.com/) platform. While the MMP is highly regarded as a fantastic handheld device, there is a notable issue: the games are not organized effectively. This lack of organization bothers me and I want to resolve this issue. In this project, the primary focus is to tackle this issue and provide a solution.

## Goals
Data Transformation and Integration
1) Reorganize games based on user ratings:
The main objective of this project is to reorganize the games and rank them based on user ratings obtained from [IGBD](https://www.igdb.com/) (Internet Game Database).

Data Extraction
2) [X] Generate a list of games for the Miyoo Mini Plus:
A comprehensive list of games for the 64GB can be accessed [here](https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FPaul-M-K%2FmmpDataExtraction%2Fmaster%2Fparsed_data.xlsx&wdOrigin=BROWSELINK).

Data Orginization
3) Sort games into correct folders for [Onion OS](https://github.com/OnionUI/Onion):
The games will be sorted into the appropriate folders within Onion OS. Although this process is relatively quick, there may be certain anomalies to address, such as the Game Boy Color folder being located within the Game Boy folder.

By achieving these goals, I aim to enhance the user experience of the Miyoo Mini Plus by ensuring that the vast game library is properly organized and easily accessible.
