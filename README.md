# Miyoo Mini Plus Data Extraction and Transformation 

## Introduction
The [Miyoo Mini Plus](https://www.keepretro.com/products/miyoo-mini-plus) (MMP) is a handheld retro gaming console, which comes with 6000+ games from various retro consoles that are capable of running on [RetroArch](https://www.retroarch.com/). The MMP is a fantastic handheld. However, there is one issue the games are **not orginized**. 
This is the biggest issue I would like to solve. So with this I want to get into the goals. 

## Goals
1) Reorginize games based on user ratings. 
- There are several goals to this project, my biggest goal is reorginize the games and rank them based on user ratings from [IGBD](https://www.igdb.com/). 
2) [X] Generate [list of games](https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FPaul-M-K%2FmmpDataExtraction%2Fmaster%2Fparsed_data.xlsx&wdOrigin=BROWSELINK) for the Miyoo Mini Plus. 
- This list is only for the 64GB model.
3) Sort games into correct folders for [Onion OS](https://github.com/OnionUI/Onion)
- Sorting the games into the correct folder does not take very long. There are just some annomolies like the Game Boy Color folder is within the Game Boy folder.
